# Neural Network Charity Analysis

Using machine learning and neural networks, create a binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

## Overview of the Loan Prediction Risk Analysis:

Using Pandas and the Scikit-Learn’s StandardScaler(), the dataset was preprocessed. This was done in order to compile, train, and evaluate the neural network model later in the analysis.

TensorFlow was used to design a neural network, or deep learning model. This was in order to create a binary classification model that can predict if an Alphabet Soup–funded organization will be successful based on the features in the dataset. The number of inputs had to be considered before determining the number of neurons and layers in the model. Finally, the binary classification model was ready to compile, train, and evaluate in order to calculate the model’s loss and accuracy. 

Using TensorFlow, the model was optimized in order to achieve a target predictive accuracy higher than 75%.

## Results:

### Data Preprocessing:

The variables that were considered the targets for the model were
The variables that were considered the features for the model were
The variables that were neither targets nor features for the model were

### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model:

Neurons, layers, and activation functions selected for your neural network model:
 and why?
Target model performance (was it achieved)?
Steps taken to try and increase model performance:

## Summary:

The overall results of the deep learning model are as follows:

A different model could also solve this classification problem. I would recommend... and explain your recommendation.
